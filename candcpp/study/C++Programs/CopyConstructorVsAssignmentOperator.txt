Copyconstructor:
1)Creating new object using the existing object
2)It does not have return type
3)We can use Initializer list
4)We cannot copy same object(obj=obj),Compiler throws Error "Redeclaration of object"

AssignmentOperator:
1)Assigning one existing object to the other existing object
2)It has return type[object by reference]
3)We cannot use Initializer list
4)We can assign same object(obj=obj),Works fine -Self Assignation

NOTE:
Due to obj=obj, Memory gets wasted 
To avoid this,We can use Self Assignment Check condition(if this != &obj)
