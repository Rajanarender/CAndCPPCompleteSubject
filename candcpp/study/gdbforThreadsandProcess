gdb displays the stack frame summary [Segmentation fault occurred func to the initiater func1,func2,func3,so on...]

gdb for threads:

(gdb) info threads
  3 process 35 thread 27  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
  2 process 35 thread 23  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
* 1 process 35 thread 13  main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
    at threadtest.c:68

(gdb) thread 1  //Here 1 is the threadnumber

Explanation of info threads: 
Display a summary of all threads currently in your program. GDB displays for each thread (in this order):

    the thread number assigned by GDB
    the target system's thread identifier (systag)
    the current stack frame summary for that thread

An asterisk `*' to the left of the GDB thread number indicates the current thread. For example,

gdb for process:

(gdb) attach pid  //This attaches gdb to a running process with pid and displays the stack frame summary
(gdb) detach
