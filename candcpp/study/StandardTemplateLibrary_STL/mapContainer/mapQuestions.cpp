**********************************************
Be careful with erase() API
Practice on that too
**********************************************

Name the container that does not have any access specifier other than iterator(*it)?

Name the data members of map that represent key and value ?

Display all Key-value pairs of a map?

Add new key-value pair to map?

Write the condition for checking whether the key-value pair is present/not present using find() and count() API

Given a Key,How to get its value?

Given a Key,delete its key-value pair

Given 2 keys,delete keys b/w these 2 keys?

Given a Key,delete all the keys greater than given key?

Given a Key,delete all the keys lesser than given key?

Delete 2nd to 4th keys in a map? //In between keys

Given a key-value pair,now modify
=>only key
=>only value
=>both key and value

Given a map,Check whether a Particular key is present or not?
If not present,insert that key value pair?

Given a Key,find how many times is it repeated?

How to insert key,value pair in map ?[use API's like pair<>(,) and make_pair(,)]

multimap is given,
=>Identify how many keys are duplicate/repeatative?Display each duplicate key?
How many times did they repeat?Delete all repeated keys
=>Identify how many keys are unique?Display each unique key

How to erase key-value pair with duplicate value,duplicate key?

How to swap values of values of 2 keys?

Can we sort the values? Keys are sorted by default

Algorithms which are common in both set and map are [including multi,unordered] ??

How to do find,count,merge,sort,reverse,remove,replace, operations in vector,deque,list containers
