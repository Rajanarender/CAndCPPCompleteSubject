****************************************************************
vector Vs array

vector:
Random access of elements -same as array
Insertion/Deletion of elements -faster/easier due to Api's


array:
Random access -same as vector
Insertion/Deletion - costlier compared to vector

****************************************************************
vector Vs list

vector:
Random access -faster/easier due to index 
Insertion/Deletion -costlier
contiguous memory


list: //Doubly linked list implementation
Random access -costlier due to traversing
Insertion/Deletion -easier, since we can traverse b/w nodes using nodes address
Non-contiguous memory
****************************************************************
map vs set

map:
Random access -faster/easier due to index 
Insertion/Deletion -costlier, since we need to insert 2elements(key,value)pair

set:
Random access -costlier, since these does not have API's 
Insertion/Deletion -easier compared to map, since only one element insertion is enough
